# DSR_MiniProject_2
This is the second mini project for the Data Science in R class

This repository contains all of the data for one of three main projects in a data science in education using R class. All documents here are an analysis of the SC reportcard data throughout five years for all traditional SC high schools. 

Specifically, this project uses mixed effects models to demonstrate the effects of both school poverty level and time on student absentee rates.
